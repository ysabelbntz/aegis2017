					<h4>What does CWS mean in the guidelines?</h4>
					<p><span class="bold">CWS stands for Characters with Spaces.</span> You may check the CWS of your write-up by going to Tools > Word Count if you are using Microsoft Word.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>When will the write-ups submission be?</h4>
					<p>As of the moment, the write-up submission dates are slated from <span class="bold">November 1-30.</span> Should there be any changes in the schedule, we will be announcing this through the website and/or through the Official AEGIS 2017 Facebook Page. You may also refer to the AEGIS 2017 Calendar for updates.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Should my write-up be in first person (e.g. “I am…”) or in third person (e.g. “He is…”)?</h4>
					<p>Because this is your yearbook, we encourage all students to write using <span class="bold">any point of view they are comfortable with.</span></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Can I ask someone else to write my write-up for me?</h4>
					<p>Yes, you may.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>What happens if I don’t submit my write-up on time, will I still be able to submit it after the deadline?</h4>
					<p>Unfortunately, due to the tight schedule,  <span class="bold">we do not allow students to submit their write-up after the deadline</span>, unless an extension has been made. Should you fail to submit your write-up, the  <span class="bold">write-up editors will be the ones to choose what generic write-up to put on your page.</span></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Will we still be able to edit our write-up after we submit it?</h4>
					<p><span class="bold">We do not allow editing after the write-ups have been submitted</span>, so please make sure that the write-up you are submitting is what you want to see in your yearbook. We do, however, have an <span class="bold">online preview</span> the following semester to give students the chance to comment any <span class="bold"><span class="italic">minor</span> changes</span> they wish to make. Any <span class="italic">major </span>changes or overhauls will not be accommodated.</span></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>What happens if I go over the CWS limit?</h4>
					<p>Should the write-up go over the CWS limit, the <span class="bold">write-up editors will be the ones to shorten it</span>, but will make sure that the essence of the write-up will be retained. If the write-up proves to be <span class="bold">too long for the write-up editor to shorten, we will be contacting you to resubmit a shorter version of your write-up.</span>However, the <span class="bold">resubmitted write-up must still be derived from the original </span>and may not be completely different write-up.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>What are examples of generic write-ups?</h4>
					<p><ul><li>“In the end, it is not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.” (Lincoln, Abraham)</li><li>“That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.” (Nietzsche, Friedrich)</li><li>“It is not in the stars to hold our destiny, but in ourselves.” (Shakespeare, William)</li></ul></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>What if I don't want my own write-up?</h4>
					<p>Even if you are not submitting your own write-up, you must still log on the website during the write-up submission period and <span class="bold">specify whether you want a generic write-up or no write-up at all</span>. Should you select the latter, the space in your yearbook page allotted for the write-up will simply be left blank.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>If I am a senior but not graduating this year, am I still required to submit a write-up?</h4>
					<p>Non-graduating students are <span class="bold">not required to submit a write-up as they will not have a write-up on the yearbook.</span> Only students who are graduating, should submit one. </p>
